## Installation

Make sure you have `nodejs`, `npm` and `git` installed first, and then run the following:

```console
npm install git-date -g
```

## Usage

`git-date` uses a hyphenated alias that allows you to run it as a native git command:

```console
git date <date string>
```

Because `git-date` uses the full power of the [date library](https://sugarjs.com/docs/#/DateParsing) provided by `sugarjs`, you can use a very large variety of commands to change the date. Below are some examples of what you could put into `<date string>`:
